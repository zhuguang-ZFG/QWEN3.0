# Personal Coding Assistant Progress

> Created: 2026-05-22

## 2026-05-22 Website Baseline

- Started persistent plan for closing chat/open-platform website issues.
- Reused prior evidence instead of repeating known-good checks blindly.
- Confirmed previous open-platform token test succeeded:
  - New API DB found at `/opt/new-api/one-api.db`.
  - Enabled channels point to `http://localhost:8080`.
  - Enabled tokens exist.
  - Local and public model/chat requests returned 200.
- Ran broader production audit for static assets, TLS/security headers, logs, backup, firewall exposure, and UI encoding.

## 2026-05-22 Production Audit And Closure

- Verified TLS expiry:
  - `chat.donglicao.com`: 2026-08-16 13:21:14 GMT.
  - `api.donglicao.com`: 2026-08-16 09:20:03 GMT.
- Found open platform title mojibake and fixed nginx sub_filter replacement.
- Found missing basic security headers and added them to chat/API nginx configs.
- Found chat `/quickstart/` serving fallback HTML for nested static paths and redirected it to `/`.
- Found direct public exposure risk for internal ports. Removed firewalld public ports `8080/3001` and added `eth0` direct reject rules for `3000/3001/3003/8080/8091`.
- Found New API backup cron overwriting a fixed dated file. Replaced it with dated daily backup and 14-day retention.
- Verified no regression:
  - Chat page/API non-stream/API stream all returned 200.
  - Open platform page/models/chat all returned 200 with valid token.
  - Internal localhost services still work for nginx.
  - Public direct internal ports are no longer reachable.

## 2026-05-22 Direction Reset

- User confirmed the product is a private personal coding assistant, not a commercial open platform.
- Added `docs/PERSONAL_CODING_ASSISTANT_PLAN.md`.
- Removed billing/quota/usage commercial modules and commercial tests from the active worktree.
- Removed active payment, public registration, open-platform upgrade, commercial roadmap, and commercial readiness docs.
- Removed commercial wiring from `server.py`, `routes/admin.py`, and deploy preflight references.

## Next Personal Assistant Work

- Validate one real IDE or terminal-agent coding workflow against the private endpoint.
- Re-test failed providers when more backend keys/rate limits/local socket policy are healthy.

## 2026-05-22 Coding Backend Eval And Routing

- Added `coding_eval.py`, `scripts/eval_coding_backends.py`, and three coding fixtures under `evals/coding_cases/`.
- Added unit tests for case loading, candidate detection, grading, run failure handling, and Markdown report ranking.
- User challenged the first ranking as too narrow; expanded from the 10-backend shortlist to a full 85-candidate smoke.
- Broad smoke found 16 `code_review` passers.
- Ran full 3-case eval for those 16 passers:
  - 3/3 pass: `scnet_large_ds_flash`, `github_gpt4o`, `github_gpt4o_mini`, `or_gptoss_120b`.
  - Fast 80+ score under 800ms: `cerebras_gptoss`, `groq_gptoss`, `mistral_small`.
  - Useful 2/3 fallback tier: `mistral_pixtral`, `mistral_large`, `mistral_devstral`, `github_codestral`, `mistral_medium`, `featherless`.
- Updated `code_orchestrator.POOLS` and `router_v3.POOLS["code"]` so the wider evidence-backed coding pool is tried first.
- Added Continue/VS Code detection to `routing_engine` and `router_v3`.
- Local IDE-routing smoke passed: `ide_source=Continue` produced `request_type=code_standard`, `scenario=coding`, backend `scnet_large_ds_flash`, and a real response in 1406ms.

## 2026-05-22 VPS Deployment

- Deployed the coding-routing changes to `/opt/lima-router` on VPS `47.112.162.80`.
- Uploaded runtime files only: `router_v3.py`, `routing_engine.py`, and `code_orchestrator.py`.
- Remote backup directory: `/opt/lima-router/backups/deploy-20260522_175739`.
- Remote `py_compile` passed for `router_v3.py`, `routing_engine.py`, `code_orchestrator.py`, and `server.py`.
- Restarted `lima-router` through `systemctl`.
- VPS local `/health` returned 200.
- VPS local OpenAI-compatible coding smoke returned 200 and routed to `github_gpt4o`.
- Public `https://chat.donglicao.com/v1/chat/completions` smoke returned 200 and routed to `cerebras_gptoss`.

## 2026-05-22 Claude Code Speed Fix

- Found the Claude Code slow path: requests with `tools` use the Anthropic `/v1/messages` tool branch, not the normal coding pool.
- Reordered `TOOL_TIER1_BACKENDS` to front-load fast tool-compatible backends: `groq_gptoss_20b`, `cerebras_gptoss`, `groq_gptoss`, GitHub, and Mistral.
- Changed tool backend retry behavior so one request tries distinct backends instead of retrying the same failed backend repeatedly.
- Added a regression test for distinct fast tool backend iteration.
- Deployed `server.py` to VPS with backup at `/opt/lima-router/backups/speed-20260522_181808`.
- Remote compile and `/health` passed after restart.
- VPS local Anthropic tool smoke returned 200 in 393ms with a real `tool_use` from `groq_gptoss_20b`.
- Public `https://chat.donglicao.com/v1/messages` tool smoke returned 200 in 819ms with a real `tool_use`.

## 2026-05-22 IDE Context Preflight

- Created `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-22-ide-context-preflight.md` and executed it task-by-task.
- Added `lima_context.py` with request-local context digest extraction for IDE source, workspace hints, task shape, language, file paths, and tool/error signals.
- Added `tests/test_lima_context.py` covering digest extraction, trivial-chat no-op behavior, max length, tool result summarization, and `code_orchestrator.enhance_context` integration.
- Injected the digest into normal coding route prompts through `code_orchestrator.enhance_context`.
- Injected the digest into Claude Code Anthropic `/v1/messages` tool requests through `server._inject_anthropic_context_preflight`.
- Kept the fast tool backend order and distinct-backend retry behavior intact.
- Local verification passed:
  - `python -m py_compile lima_context.py code_orchestrator.py server.py routing_engine.py router_v3.py`
  - `python -m pytest -q test_routing_engine.py test_rate_limiter.py test_http_caller.py test_streaming.py tests/test_coding_eval.py tests/test_lima_context.py` -> `70 passed in 0.51s`
- Deployed `server.py`, `code_orchestrator.py`, and `lima_context.py` to VPS with backup at `/opt/lima-router/backups/context-preflight-20260522_183133`.
- Remote compile and `/health` passed after `systemctl restart lima-router`.
- Synced a no-BOM `code_orchestrator.py` copy after local cleanup with backup at `/opt/lima-router/backups/context-preflight-sync-20260522_183423`.
- Final remote compile and `/health` passed after restart.
- Final public Anthropic tool smoke returned 200 in 600ms with `stop_reason=tool_use`.

## 2026-05-22 Free Model Routing Refresh

- Checked whether all SCNet and Kimi-family free models were actually in use.
- Confirmed registration exists in `backends.py`, but routing did not actively use all working free capacity.
- Ran VPS smoke for SCNet/Kimi-family candidates:
  - Working: `scnet_ds_flash`, `scnet_ds_pro`, `scnet_qwen235b`, `scnet_qwen30b`, `cf_kimi_k26`.
  - Not production-live in smoke: `scnet_minimax`, `scnet_large_ds_flash`, `scnet_large_ds_pro`, `stock_kimi_k2`, `kimi`, `kimi_thinking`, `kimi_search`.
- Updated `code_orchestrator.py` and `router_v3.py` so VPS-working free SCNet models are active fallback capacity.
- Kept local proxy models registered but late because VPS ports `4504` and `4505` refused connections.
- Added `docs/FREE_MODEL_ROUTING_STATUS.md`.
- Added `docs/LIMA_MEMORY.md` as the detailed durable memory document.
- Local verification after route changes passed: `71 passed in 0.52s`.
- Deployed `code_orchestrator.py` and `router_v3.py` to VPS with backup at `/opt/lima-router/backups/free-model-routing-20260522_184556`.
- `systemctl restart lima-router` initially hung because uvicorn was waiting for open connections to close; fixed by `systemctl kill -s SIGKILL lima-router`, `systemctl reset-failed lima-router`, then `systemctl start lima-router`.
- VPS `/health` returned 200 after recovery.
- Public coding smoke returned 200 in 4585ms.
- Public Anthropic tool smoke returned 200 in 672ms with `stop_reason=tool_use`.
